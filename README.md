# GMIT-Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2018

This project concerns the well-known Fisher Iris dataset. The project requirements entail researching the dataset and writing documentation and Python code based on that research.

The following are some guidelines for the project content:
1.	Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2.	Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3.	Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4.	Summarise the data set using python scripts (eg. calculate the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set).
5.	Write a summary of your investigations.
6.	Include supporting tables and graphics.

## Background information about the Iris dataset(1)

The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information compiled by [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher),a British statistician and geneticist,in the 1930s. It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flower’s reproductive system.The Iris flower data set is now widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science.

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of [linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis).It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

## Use of the data set (2)
Fisher’s Iris flower data set is an excellent example of a traditional resource that has become a staple of the computing world, especially for testing purposes. New types of sorting models and taxonomy algorithms often use the Iris flower data set as an input, to examine how various technologies sort and handle data sets. Programmers might, for example, download the Iris flower data set for the purposes of testing a decision tree, or a piece of machine learning software. For this reason, the Iris flower data set is built into some coding libraries, in order to make this process easier.

The Iris flower data set has also been used to explore the world of data mining, as in its use by the IBM Watson analytics engine.
Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many [statistical classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines[5].

The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is not common, since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation. One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used. This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining: Fisher's linear discriminant model can only be obtained when the object species are known: class labels and clusters are not necessarily the same.[6]
