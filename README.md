# GMIT-Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2018

This project concerns the well-known Fisher Iris dataset. The project requirements entail researching the dataset and writing documentation and Python code based on that research.

The following are some guidelines for the project content:
1.	Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2.	Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3.	Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4.	Summarise the data set using python scripts (eg. calculate the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set).
5.	Write a summary of your investigations.
6.	Include supporting tables and graphics.
